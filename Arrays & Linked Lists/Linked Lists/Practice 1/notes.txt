Linked List Practice

Implement a linked list class. You have to define a few functions that perform the desirbale action. Your LinkedList class should be able to:

Append data to the tail of the list and prepend to the head
Search the linked list for a value and return the node
Remove a node
Pop, which means to return the first node's value and delete the node from the list
Insert data at some position in the list
Return the size (length) of the linked list

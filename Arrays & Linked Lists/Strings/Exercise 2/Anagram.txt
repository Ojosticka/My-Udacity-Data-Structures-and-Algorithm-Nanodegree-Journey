Anagrams

The goal of this exercise is to write some code to determine if two strings are anagrams of each other.

An anagram is a word (or phrase) that is formed by rearranging the letters of another word (or phrase).

For example:

"rat" is an anagram of "art"
"alert" is an anagram of "alter"
"Slot machines" is an anagram of "Cash lost in me"
Your function should take two strings as input and return True if the two words are anagrams and False if they are not.

You can assume the following about the input strings:

No punctuation
No numbers
No special characters
Note - You can use built-in methods len(), lower() and sort() on strings.

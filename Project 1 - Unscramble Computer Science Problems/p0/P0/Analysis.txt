Unscramble Computer Science Problems
Project 1

"Task0.py"
Time Complexity: O(1)
Description: Input does not affect run time
Space Complexity: O(1)

"Task1.py"
Time Complexity: O(n)
Description: Two lists are looped through once each through the function. O(n+n) -> O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)

"Task2.py"
Time Complexity: O(n)
Description: List is looped through just once
Space Complexity: O(n) + O(n) = O(2n) -> O(n)

"Task3.py"
Time Complexity: O(n+nlogn) -> O(nlogn)
Description: For loop(O(n)) and python sort(O(nlogn))
Space Complexity: O(2n) -> O(n)

"Task4.py"
Time Complexity: O(n+n+nlogn) -> O(2n + nlogn) -> O(nlogn)
Description: Two For loops looped separately and python sort
Space Complexity: O(4n) -> O(n)
